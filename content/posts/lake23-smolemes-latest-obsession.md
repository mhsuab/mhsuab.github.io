This was a <u>reverse</u> challenge with a **remote server**(?) that we need to find the flag to pass the checks(?).
Overall I really enjoy reversing the challenge and how the author set it up.
This blog will describe how I solved the challenge during the CTF and interesting stuff I learnt from the challenge.

## Problem Description
<sup>*REVERSE, 338*</sup>

We are given two files, [chal](https://github.com/mhsuab/ctf/blob/fe013d3d3d106dba2f82237bb9845a9bfcf3806b/lake23/smolenes_latest_obsession/challenge/chal) and [runchal.bash](https://github.com/mhsuab/ctf/blob/fe013d3d3d106dba2f82237bb9845a9bfcf3806b/lake23/smolenes_latest_obsession/challenge/runchal.bash), and the description:

> One of their servers is running a weird shell... The `runchal.bash` is how they run it, so we are missing the prompt file, but maybe we can still retrieve its contents? Go FORTH, and find the flag! Should be as easy as `1 1 + 2 eq `.
